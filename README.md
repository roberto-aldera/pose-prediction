# pose-prediction
Attempting to predict the next pose given what's gone before now.
By using prior information (just pose estimates really), can we train an LSTM to predict where we'll be next?
This was a research interest for a portion of 2020, when looking into how we might improve radar-only egomotion estimation accuracy.
